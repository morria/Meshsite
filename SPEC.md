# Meshsites — Protocol Specification v1 (draft 8)

Tiny sites served by Meshtastic nodes to directly-reachable clients. A server
is any node (typically radio + attached computer) that answers requests with
small text pages. A client discovers nearby servers passively and browses
their pages. Think Gopher-over-LoRa: read-mostly, slow, local by physics.

Design goals, in order:

1. **Zero mesh burden.** Meshsites traffic never consumes relay airtime.
   Everything is direct RF between two radios that can already hear each other.
2. **One-packet requests.** A request always fits a single LoRa frame.
3. **Small pages.** Hard cap 3 040 bytes compressed (16 × 190) per response.
4. **Trivially implementable.** A weekend project in any language with a
   Meshtastic serial/BLE API.

## 1. Transport

- Carried in Meshtastic `MeshPacket` / `Data` payloads on **port 421**
  (private application range 256–511).
- All frames are unicast except BEACON, which is broadcast (`to = 0xFFFFFFFF`).
- Every Meshsites packet MUST be sent with **`hop_limit = 1`**.
- Receivers MUST discard any Meshsites frame that was relayed: if the received
  packet has `hop_start > 0 && hop_limit < hop_start`, drop it silently.
  Combined with `hop_limit = 1`, this bounds all Meshsites traffic to the
  direct RF link between client and server.
- REQUEST, CHUNK, and NOT_MODIFIED frames SHOULD set `want_ack` (a lost
  NOT_MODIFIED otherwise costs the client a full timeout). The server SHOULD
  pace chunk transmission: send chunk *n+1* only after chunk *n* is acked or
  8 seconds have passed. ERROR and BEACON frames MUST NOT set `want_ack`.
- Maximum Meshsites frame payload: **200 bytes** (fits every modem preset).
  Received frames larger than this are malformed — ignore them.
- All frames travel on the sending node's **primary channel** (index 0).
  BEACON is broadcast with that channel's encryption. Unicast frames
  (REQUEST, CHUNK, ERROR, NOT_MODIFIED) MAY arrive under channel **or PKI**
  encryption: transport firmware auto-upgrades unicasts to PKI when it holds
  a key for the destination, and senders cannot reliably opt out, so
  receivers MUST accept both. Decryption is the radio's job; the Meshsites
  layer never inspects or requires either mode. *(Changed in draft 8 —
  draft 7 forbade PKI unicast, which real firmware cannot honor.)*
- **Operational requirement**: `device.rebroadcast_mode` MUST NOT be
  `CORE_PORTNUMS_ONLY` on either radio — that setting silently drops
  non-core portnums (including 421) on receive, upstream of any client or
  server code. Use `ALL`. *(Added in draft 8, found the hard way.)*
- **Sender verification**: a client MUST accept CHUNK, ERROR, and
  NOT_MODIFIED frames only from the node its REQUEST was addressed to.
  Frames matching a pending id but arriving from any other node are ignored
  (ids travel in the clear; without this rule any nearby node could forge a
  response).
- Servers and clients MUST ignore frames with unknown type bytes (forward
  compatibility). Malformed frames are ignored silently, with one exception:
  a malformed REQUEST addressed to the server whose id is still parseable
  (e.g. empty path, body bytes on a GET) gets ERROR 3 so the client can fail
  fast instead of timing out. Exception: a REQUEST with version 0 is a
  version problem, not a malformation — it gets ERROR 6, never ERROR 3
  (§2, §7).

## 2. Frames

The first payload byte is the frame type. Multi-byte integers are big-endian.
Implementer warning: the request id sits at a different offset per frame
type — REQUEST and CHUNK carry a version byte first (id at offset 2);
ERROR and NOT_MODIFIED do not (id at offset 1).

### 0x01 BEACON  (server → broadcast)

```
[0x01][version u8 = 1][site name, UTF-8, 1–40 bytes]
```

Site names MUST NOT contain control characters or bidirectional-override
characters; clients strip them before display (a beacon name is untrusted
input rendered in UI).

Sent on server startup and every 5 minutes ± 30 s jitter thereafter.
"Startup" means each transition into the serving-and-radio-connected state
(app-lifecycle servers toggle and reconnect); a site-name change is announced
at the next regular beacon, never immediately — no beacon-per-keystroke.
Clients treat a site as gone if no beacon is heard for 20 minutes.
Version is the highest protocol version the server speaks; v1 clients
MAY browse any server whose beacon version ≥ 1. Out-of-spec beacons
(version 0, empty name, name longer than 40 bytes) are discarded whole —
clients MUST NOT truncate-and-accept, so all clients agree on which sites
exist.

### 0x02 REQUEST  (client → server)

```
[0x02][version u8][id u16][method u8][etag u32][path_len u8][path+query UTF-8][body bytes…]
```

- `version`: the highest protocol version the client speaks (currently 1,
  MUST be ≥ 1). The server answers in the highest version both sides speak;
  if the server's *minimum* is above the client's version, it answers
  ERROR 6 UNSUPPORTED_VERSION (message MAY state the supported range).

- `id`: random nonzero, chosen by the client, echoed in every response
  frame. A client MUST NOT reuse an id it has an outstanding request for.
  A REQUEST with id 0 is malformed; the server SHOULD answer ERROR 3
  echoing id 0 (no compliant client will match it, which is fine — clients
  ignore unmatched response frames).
- `method`: 0 = GET, 1 = POST.
- `etag`: the client's cached validator for this exact path+query (see §3.5),
  or 0 if it has none. MUST be 0 for POST; a server ignores a nonzero etag
  on POST rather than rejecting it.
- `path+query`: absolute path starting `/`, optionally `?k=v&k2=v2`
  (URL-encoded). `path_len` counts these bytes. Max 120 bytes.
- `body`: POST only — `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` pairs, uncompressed.
  A GET frame MUST NOT carry bytes after the path; servers reject one that
  does with ERROR 3.
- The whole frame MUST fit in one packet (≤ 200 bytes). Clients enforce this
  by truncating form values before sending.

### 0x03 CHUNK  (server → client)

```
[0x03][version u8][id u16][seq u8][total u8][etag u32][data bytes…]
```

- `version`: the protocol/page-format version of this response, identical in
  every chunk. It MUST NOT exceed the REQUEST's version — this is what lets
  a newer client render old pages correctly and a newer server keep serving
  old clients. Clients ignore chunks with version 0 or above their own.

- Response content = **raw DEFLATE (RFC 1951, no zlib/gzip header)** of the
  UTF-8 Meshdown page, split in order across `total` chunks.
- `seq` is 0-based; `total` is identical in every chunk and MUST be ≤ 16.
- `etag` is the validator of the page being served (§3.5), identical in every
  chunk of a response.
- All chunks except the last SHOULD carry the maximum data payload
  (**190 bytes**) so the client can estimate progress.

### 0x04 ERROR  (server → client)

```
[0x04][id u16][code u8][message UTF-8, optional, ≤ 120 bytes]
```

Codes: 1 NOT_FOUND · 2 TOO_LARGE · 3 BAD_REQUEST · 4 SERVER_ERROR · 5 BUSY ·
6 UNSUPPORTED_VERSION.

Clients strip control and bidirectional-override characters from the
message before displaying it.

### 0x05 NOT_MODIFIED  (server → client)

```
[0x05][id u16][etag u32]
```

Sent instead of chunks when the REQUEST's etag matches the current page
(§3.5). One packet ends the transaction — this is what makes revalidation
nearly free.

## 3. Reliability

- Link-level retransmission comes from `want_ack` (firmware handles it).
  A client MAY additionally treat a transport-level NAK (routing error) for
  its REQUEST packet as immediate failure instead of waiting out the timeout.
- If a client's reassembly is incomplete **45 seconds** after the most recent
  frame for that id (or after the request, if nothing arrived), the request
  fails. The client MAY retry once, and SHOULD reuse the same id so the
  server's response cache can re-serve the already-rendered chunks.
- The server SHOULD cache the rendered response (chunks or NOT_MODIFIED)
  per `(requester, id)` for 2 minutes, keyed by the *full* request content
  with the POST etag normalized to 0 first (it's ignored anyway — §2, and
  normalizing keeps an etag-varying POST retry cacheable): if the same id
  arrives with different content (random u16 ids do collide), render fresh
  and replace the entry. A duplicate of a
  request that is still being answered is dropped silently — it is most
  likely a link-level retransmit, and BUSY would be wrong. The cache SHOULD
  be size-bounded with oldest-first eviction — `requester` is
  unauthenticated, so spoofed sources must not grow it without limit.
- A server MAY treat a transport-level NAK for a CHUNK it sent as "peer
  unreachable" and abort the remaining chunks of that response (the cached
  response still serves a later retry).
- The server maintains at most **one in-flight response per requester**; a
  second concurrent REQUEST from the same node gets ERROR 5 BUSY. Distinct
  requesters MAY be served concurrently but the server SHOULD serialize radio
  writes.

## 3.5 Caching and cache busting

Airtime is the scarce resource; a full page is up to 16 packets while a
revalidation is 2. Caching is validator-based — there are no freshness
lifetimes to get wrong, and busting is automatic because the validator is a
content hash.

- **etag** = FNV-1a 32-bit hash of the page's UTF-8 Meshdown bytes
  (*before* compression, so implementations' DEFLATE differences don't
  matter): `h = 2166136261; for each byte b: h = (h XOR b) × 16777619 mod 2³²`.
  If the result is 0, substitute 1 (0 on the wire means "no validator").
- **Server**: render the page, compute its etag. If the REQUEST carried the
  same etag, answer 0x05 NOT_MODIFIED; otherwise serve chunks carrying the
  etag. Applies to GET only — POST is never answered NOT_MODIFIED. Dynamic
  pages need no special handling: when their content changes, the hash
  changes, and the cache busts itself.
- **Client**: cache at most one entry per `(server, path+query)`:
  `{etag, page, fetched-at}`. On GET, send the cached etag; on NOT_MODIFIED
  render the cached page; on chunks replace the entry. A client MUST only
  send an etag whose page it still holds. POST responses MUST NOT be cached
  or served from cache.
- **Back navigation** MAY be served straight from cache with no request at
  all. Ordinary navigation and user-initiated refresh SHOULD revalidate
  (send the etag). Cache entries SHOULD be dropped after 24 hours — the
  hash guarantees correctness, expiry just bounds storage.

## 4. Meshdown

Line-oriented UTF-8. Every line is one of:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `# T` / `## T` / `### T` | heading, levels 1–3 |
| `* text` | list item |
| `=> /path Label text` | link (path may carry `?query`) |
| `---` | horizontal rule |
| `[form get /path]` or `[form post /path]` | opens a form |
| `[field name Label text]` | text input inside a form (name = `[a-z0-9_]+`) |
| `[submit Label]` | submit button inside a form |
| `[/form]` | closes a form |
| blank | block separator |
| anything else | paragraph text |

- Form lines outside `[form]`…`[/form]` are rendered as plain paragraphs.
- Submission: `get` → request `path?name=value&…` (joined with `&` if the
  form path already carries a query); `post` → pairs go in the REQUEST body.
  Both URL-encoded (space as `%20`). Clients enforce the one-packet request
  rule by truncating form values before sending.
- Clients render unknown `[…]` lines as plain text (forward compatibility).
- Edge cases, pinned down so every client renders alike:
  - Servers SHOULD emit LF line endings; clients MUST tolerate CRLF and
    trailing whitespace on any line.
  - Plain text inside an open form renders as if it preceded the form.
  - An unclosed `[form]` at end of page is implicitly closed.
  - A form with no `[submit]` line gets a default "Submit" button; a form
    with zero fields is legal (button-only actions).
  - Duplicate `[field]` names within one form: later duplicates are dropped.
  - Malformed bracket lines (bare `[submit]`, bad method, bad field name)
    render as plain text like any unknown line.

## 5. Server behavior

- `GET /` MUST return the home page.
- Static mapping: `/foo` → `foo.md` in the site directory; `/` → `index.md`.
  Requests containing `..` (checked **after** percent-decoding, so `%2e%2e`
  is caught), empty paths, or paths not starting `/` get ERROR 3. Unknown
  paths get ERROR 1.
- An empty (0-byte) file is not a page — ERROR 1, same as absent.
- A page that exists but is temporarily unreadable (e.g. a cloud-sync
  placeholder on a phone-hosted server) gets ERROR 4 with a short message
  (bounded by ERROR's 120-byte limit); clients MAY retry later.
- Dynamic handlers (e.g. a guestbook POST target) are server-local details;
  a handler answers with a normal Meshdown page or an ERROR.
- Stored form input MUST be sanitized against storage-format injection
  (strip newlines and control characters from names, values, and the
  request path before persisting) and MUST be size-bounded overall (this
  implementation family: 128 KB, oldest entries dropped).
- If a page deflates to more than 16 chunks, respond ERROR 2 (preferred) or
  serve a server-trimmed page.
- Servers MUST NOT initiate anything toward a client except BEACON and
  responses to that client's requests.

## 6. Client behavior

- Discovery is **passive only** — no probe frames; sites appear as beacons
  are heard and expire 20 minutes after the last one.
- Enforce the relay-discard and sender-verification rules (§1) on every
  received frame.
- Enforce the one-packet request rule by bounding form input length.
- Decompressed page size cap: 65 536 bytes inclusive; a response exceeding
  it is discarded as malformed (defense against decompression bombs).
- One in-flight request per server; UI SHOULD show chunk progress.
- The discovered-sites list SHOULD be size-bounded (beacon senders are
  unauthenticated; cap and evict oldest-heard).
- Clients MAY refuse to browse servers whose beacon version is below the
  client's minimum supported version, explaining that the site is outdated
  — this is the deprecation path for retiring old servers.

## 7. Versioning

One u8 protocol version (currently 1) flows through three places:

- **BEACON** advertises the server's *highest* version — clients use it to
  badge or refuse outdated servers before ever sending a request.
- **REQUEST** carries the client's highest version — a server never has to
  guess what the requester can render.
- **CHUNK** tags the response with the version actually used, which is
  `min(client max, server max)`; if the server's minimum exceeds the
  client's version the answer is ERROR 6.

Rules: version 0 is invalid anywhere. A page format change (new Meshdown
syntax) or frame semantic change bumps the version; clients keep old
renderers and select by the CHUNK version, servers keep serving the highest
version each requester speaks. Deprecation is client-driven: raising a
client's minimum retires old servers gracefully (they show as outdated, not
broken). ERROR and NOT_MODIFIED intentionally carry no version byte: they
are terminal one-packet frames, and their layouts are frozen for all
protocol versions — the cached page a NOT_MODIFIED refers to keeps the
version it was originally served with.

v2 candidates (explicitly out of scope for v1): chunk re-request (selective
NACK), binary resource frames (images), multi-packet requests.

## Appendix: changes from draft 7

Both changes came out of the first interop between independent client and
server implementations (2026-08-25/26):

1. **§1 encryption**: draft 7 said "PKI-encrypted unicast MUST NOT be
   used." Meshtastic firmware auto-upgrades unicasts to PKI when it holds a
   key for the destination and senders cannot reliably opt out, so the rule
   was unimplementable. Receivers now MUST accept unicast frames under
   channel or PKI encryption. BEACON is unchanged (broadcast, channel
   crypto).
2. **§1 operational requirement**: `device.rebroadcast_mode =
   CORE_PORTNUMS_ONLY` silently drops non-core portnums on receive and MUST
   NOT be set on Meshsites radios.
